 # Project Overview
This document outlines the setup and configuration of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for our project. The setup encompasses development with Docker containers, deployment management with Kubernetes, and automation via Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Build.

Local Development Environment Setup with Docker
For local development, we use Docker to ensure that our environment is consistent and replicable. This approach allows any developer to run a local version of our application with minimal setup, ensuring that the code operates in an environment similar to production.

Docker Compose
We employ docker-compose to orchestrate multiple containers that make up our application. This includes services like our main application server, auxiliary services, and databases. The docker-compose.yml file specifies the configuration of these services, including environment variables, volume mounts, and network settings.

# Example snippet from docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'
services:
app:
build: .
ports: - "8080:8080"
volumes: - .:/app
environment: - NODE_ENV=development
db:
image: mongo
ports: - "27017:27017"
This setup ensures that all team members can work with the same configurations that are expected in production.

Kubernetes Configuration
Our application is deployed on Kubernetes, which allows for scalable and resilient hosting. Kubernetes configurations are defined in YAML files, specifying how our application and its components are deployed across a cluster.

Deployment and Services
We manage separate configurations for different components like frontend, backend, and databases. Here are the key elements:

Deployments: Manage the deployment of containerized applications. For instance, k8-backend.yaml and k8-frontend.yaml define the deployment strategies, replicas, and resource requests.
Services: Define how to expose our applications to traffic. k8-frontend-service.yaml outlines the service configuration for the frontend, exposing it via a LoadBalancer.
# Example snippet from k8-frontend-service.yaml

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: frontend-service
spec:
selector:
app: frontend
ports: - protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 8080
type: LoadBalancer
Google Cloud Platform Setup
We leverage GCP for hosting our Kubernetes cluster and for automating our CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build.

# Cloud Build Configuration
Our cloudBuild.yaml file specifies the steps required for continuous integration and deployment. Each git commit triggers an automated process that builds our Docker containers, runs tests, and if successful, deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

# Example snippet from cloudBuild.yaml

steps:

- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-app:$SHORT_SHA', '.']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  args: ['apply', '-f', 'kubernetes/', '--namespace=production']
  images:
- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-app:$SHORT_SHA'
 # Security and Permissions
To manage permissions and security within GCP, we utilize IAM roles to ensure that only authorized users and services can access specific resources. Cloud Build is configured with permissions to interact with Kubernetes Engine and Container Registry.

# Conclusion
The above configuration ensures a seamless flow from development to production. By leveraging Docker for local development, Kubernetes for orchestration, and GCP for CI/CD automation, we maintain a robust, scalable, and efficient workflow.

# Deploy.yaml

The deploy.yaml file you provided is a GitHub Actions workflow file. It defines a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically builds and deploys your project to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of your GitHub repository. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Trigger: The on: push: branches: - main part of the workflow file specifies that this workflow should be triggered whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of your repository.

Job Setup: The jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest part specifies that the job named deploy should be run on the latest version of the Ubuntu virtual environment provided by GitHub Actions.

Checkout Code: The Checkout code step uses the actions/checkout@v2 action to checkout your repository's code onto the runner. This means it makes your repository's code available to the rest of the steps in the workflow.

Set up Google Cloud SDK: The Set up Google Cloud SDK step uses the google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@master action to setup the Google Cloud SDK on the runner. This SDK is required to interact with GCP. The service_account_key and project_id inputs are set using secrets stored in your GitHub repository. The GCP_SA_KEY secret should contain a GCP service account key that has the necessary permissions to deploy your project.

Build and Deploy: The Build and Deploy step runs the gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml command. This command uses Google Cloud Build to build your project and deploy it to GCP. The cloudbuild.yaml file should contain the instructions for building your project and deploying it to GCP using Kubernetes.

# GCP Setup

Create a Kubernetes Cluster: You can create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Navigate to the GKE page in the Google Cloud Console, click on "Create Cluster", and follow the prompts to configure your cluster. You'll need to specify details like the cluster name, location, and size.

Configure kubectl: After creating your cluster, you'll need to configure the kubectl command-line tool to interact with it. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to your cluster's details page and click on the "Connect" button. This will give you a command that you can run in your local terminal to configure kubectl.

Create a Docker Image: Your application needs to be packaged as a Docker image to be run on Kubernetes. This involves writing a Dockerfile that specifies how to build your application, and then running the docker build command to create the image.

Push Docker Image to Google Container Registry (GCR): After building your Docker image, you'll need to push it to GCR. This involves tagging the image with the GCR registry name and then running the docker push command.

Create a Kubernetes Deployment: A Kubernetes Deployment specifies how your application should be run on the cluster. You'll need to write a Deployment manifest file that specifies details like the Docker image to use, the number of replicas to run, and any environment variables to set.

Apply the Deployment: You can apply the Deployment to your cluster by running the kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml command, where deploy.yaml is the path to your Deployment manifest file.

Set up Triggers: To automatically deploy your application when changes are pushed to your GitHub repository, you can set up a trigger in Google Cloud Build. This involves specifying the GitHub repository to watch and the build configuration to use. The build configuration will need to include steps to build your Docker image, push it to GCR, and apply your Kubernetes Deployment.
