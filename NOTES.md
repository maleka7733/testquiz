# Project Overview

This document outlines the setup and configuration of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for our project. The setup encompasses development with Docker containers, deployment management with Kubernetes, and automation via Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Build.

## Local Development Environment Setup with Docker

For local development, we use Docker to ensure that our environment is consistent and replicable. This approach allows any developer to run a local version of our application with minimal setup, ensuring that the code operates in an environment similar to production.

### Docker Compose

We employ docker-compose to orchestrate multiple containers that make up our application. This includes services like our main application server, auxiliary services, and databases. The docker-compose.yml file specifies the configuration of these services, including environment variables, volume mounts, and network settings.

```
# Example snippet from docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'
services:
app:
build: .
ports: - "8080:8080"
volumes: - .:/app
environment: - NODE_ENV=development
db:
image: mongo
ports: - "27017:27017"
```

This setup ensures that all team members can work with the same configurations that are expected in production.

## Kubernetes Configuration

Our application is deployed on Kubernetes, which allows for scalable and resilient hosting. Kubernetes configurations are defined in YAML files, specifying how our application and its components are deployed across a cluster.

### Deployment and Services

We manage separate configurations for different components like frontend, backend, and databases. Here are the key elements:

- Deployments: Manage the deployment of containerized applications. For instance, k8-backend.yaml and k8-frontend.yaml define the deployment strategies, replicas, and resource requests.
- Services: Define how to expose our applications to traffic. k8-frontend-service.yaml outlines the service configuration for the frontend, exposing it via a LoadBalancer.

```
# Example snippet from k8-frontend-service.yaml

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: frontend-service
spec:
selector:
app: frontend
ports: - protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 8080
type: LoadBalancer
```

## Google Cloud Platform Setup

We leverage GCP for hosting our Kubernetes cluster and for automating our CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build.

### Cloud Build Configuration

Our cloudBuild.yaml file specifies the steps required for continuous integration and deployment. Each git commit triggers an automated process that builds our Docker containers, runs tests, and if successful, deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

```
# Example snippet from cloudBuild.yaml

steps:

- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-app:$SHORT_SHA', '.']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  args: ['apply', '-f', 'kubernetes/', '--namespace=production']
  images:
- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-app:$SHORT_SHA'
```

### Security and Permissions

To manage permissions and security within GCP, we utilize IAM roles to ensure that only authorized users and services can access specific resources. Cloud Build is configured with permissions to interact with Kubernetes Engine and Container Registry.

## Conclusion

The above configuration ensures a seamless flow from development to production. By leveraging Docker for local development, Kubernetes for orchestration, and GCP for CI/CD automation, we maintain a robust, scalable, and efficient workflow.
